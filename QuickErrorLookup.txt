100-200 everything good continue
201 creates the content in a URI and can result in a 202
202 is a pending request and should have a timestamp of when resources are given
203 is a 200 but the info provided was sourced elsewhere 
204 accepted the connection but the server has no content to return - good skip for parsing here
205 allows user input
206 The request MUST have included a Range header field
300 The thing requested was found but exists in multiple versions such as different file type, choose one
301 Site has been moved, provides a url to the new site
302 Site is temporarily at a different URL, keep using the old one
303 I handled your request, using GET go look at this other url for your results
304 The page has not been changed since you last looked at it - can follow any error code including 200 - would be good to check for skipping parsing
305 the requested resources must be found at the provided proxy in the location field
306 A resevered code that doesnt do anything
307 The resource is temporarily at another URL, go there and repeat request
400 The client performed a request with bad syntax, must be modified before requesting again
401 The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field 
402 Requires payment - skip these
403 Forbidden request, do not come here again
404 Not Found or reason isnt being given - skip these
405 The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI.
406 Not Acceptable, The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.
407 This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. 
408 Request Timeout- The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time.
